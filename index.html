        <h1>Earth</h1>
        <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known celestial body to support life. It has a diverse environment, featuring vast oceans, continents, mountains, forests, and deserts. With a surface composed of 71% water and a dynamic atmosphere made up primarily of nitrogen and oxygen, Earth maintains a delicate balance that sustains life. Its geological activity, including tectonic movement, volcanic eruptions, and the water cycle, continuously reshapes the planet's surface. Earth's climate is influenced by its tilt, orbit, and interaction with the Sun, creating diverse ecosystems and weather patterns around the globe.</p>
